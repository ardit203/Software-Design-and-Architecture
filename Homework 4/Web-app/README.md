# Code Refactoring

## MVC pattern
Refactored the whole code from Homework 3, now to use MVC pattern

## Database
Added a Database class that follows the Singleton Design Pattern to ensure there is only one instance of the database connection throughout the application.

## Naming
Variable and method names have been updated to be more descriptive and meaningful
